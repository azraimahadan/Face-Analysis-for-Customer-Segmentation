# Face-Analysis-for-Customer-Segmentation
Affiliation with Dept. of Computer Science And Engineering, Korea University

This project utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect and analyze faces in real-time. It predicts the age, gender, and ethnicity of individuals from live video feeds.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

- **Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces and predict age, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time face analysis.
- **OpenCV**: Handles video capture and face detection in real-time.
- **Haar Cascades**: Utilizes pre-trained cascades for face detection.
